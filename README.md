i. Steps Taken to Get to the Final Version of the Code:
  1.Initial Assessment and Planning:  The first step involved carefully reviewing the assignment instructions and understanding the task requirements. I then conducted an initial assessment of the provided codebase to identify the specified page for extraction.
  2. Extraction Process: Following the provided guidance steps, I created a new React app and imported dependencies from the existing project. I focused on extracting the assigned page as a standalone project, ensuring to structure the files according to the prescribed format.
  3. Refactoring and Repository Structure: I refactored the codebase to fit the prescribed repository format, maintaining a clean and organized structure. This involved importing only the necessary components and removing any redundant files or code blocks.

ii. Reasoning for Inability to Strictly Stick to the Provided Folder Structure:
While I aimed to strictly stick to the provided folder structure, certain adjustments were necessary to optimize the extraction and refactoring process. The complexity of the codebase and the need for time efficiency led to minor deviations from the prescribed structure. However, I ensured that the final repository structure remained organized and aligned with the overarching guidelines.


iii. Reasoning for Inability to Get Rid of All Redundant Code in the Given Timeframe:
Despite diligent efforts, it was challenging to eliminate all redundant code within the given timeframe. The task involved working with a comprehensive codebase, and identifying and removing redundant code required thorough analysis and testing. Time constraints limited the extent to which I could conduct such meticulous optimization. However, I prioritized removing code that was not essential for rendering the assigned page, thereby focusing on optimizing the critical aspects of the project.
