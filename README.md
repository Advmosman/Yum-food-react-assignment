## i. Steps Taken to Get to the Final Version of the Code: 
1. Review and Planning: Carefully assessed assignment instructions and the provided codebase to understand requirements.
2. Extraction: Created a new React app, imported dependencies, and extracted the assigned page.
3. Refactoring: Restructured the codebase to fit prescribed repository format, focusing on cleanliness and organization. Removed redundant files and code blocks.


## ii. Reasoning for Inability to Strictly Stick to the Provided Folder Structure: 

 While I aimed to strictly stick to the provided folder structure, certain adjustments were necessary to optimize the extraction and refactoring process. The complexity of the codebase and the need for time efficiency led to minor deviations from the prescribed structure. However, I ensured that the final repository structure remained organized and aligned with the overarching guidelines.


## iii. Reasoning for Inability to Get Rid of All Redundant Code in the Given Timeframe: 

Despite diligent efforts, it was challenging to eliminate all redundant code within the given timeframe. The task involved working with a comprehensive codebase, and identifying and removing redundant code required thorough analysis and testing. Time constraints limited the extent to which I could conduct such meticulous optimization. However, I prioritized removing code that was not essential for rendering the assigned page, thereby focusing on optimizing the critical aspects of the project.
